## 📍About Me
👩‍💻 Hiya, I'm Kaylee. My pronouns are she/her/hers. I made this account because I did a coding bootcamp and then applied for like 300 jobs before I gave up on the ordeal. Now I'm $13k in debt on a high interest loan and it's gone to collections. Yay.

💡 I’m still kinda-sorta interested in front end development, UI/UX design, and HTML/CSS. I like video game mods that fix issues game devs couldn't or won't. I want to make some of my own someday. For now I make cosmetic mods here and there.

🗣️ I'm a gamer, geek, nerd, all-around fangirl. I'm disabled and queer so gaining equal rights for the LGBTQ+ community globally is a cause close to my heart, as is true accessibility in all spaces, both online and off.
